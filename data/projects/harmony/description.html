Winner of Top Overall for CodeDay Spring 2016. Built using node, express, and the googleapis package. Backgrounds are automatically pulled from konachan using a custom API wrapper, from the `nobody scenic` tags. Special thanks to Rob for helping our group get started with node and helping us when we were stuck :)
