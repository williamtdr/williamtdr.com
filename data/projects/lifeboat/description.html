	Server Website
</a>

<b>The largest server network for Minecraft: Pocket Edition.</b>
<p>
	It started when a friend and I created the first scripts to allow players of the mobile version of Minecraft to compete against each other in automated tournaments. It evolved into a complete system with authentication, player statistics, and six complete gametypes.
</p>
<p>
	Spanned 300 physical machines in two datacenters, serving over ten million players and forty-seven thousand concurrently. Maintained the game server software, custom plugins, database and API endpoints, and custom loadbalancer.
