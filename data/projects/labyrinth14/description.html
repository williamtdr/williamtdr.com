Two-player strategy game between a maze runner and a maze maker. Created in 24 hours for CodeDay Winter 2016.<br>
<br>
<p>
	The objective of the maze runner is to find the treasure (blue dome). They have a floating compass (red arrow) pointing them towards the treasure.
	The maze maker is trying to prevent the maze runner from reaching their objective. They can place down various traps that the maze runner has to circumvent. The maze maker does not know where the objective is.
	Players alternate roles, with two minutes for the maze runner and thirty seconds for the maze maker.
